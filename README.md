# AI Weeder

AI Weeder is an open-source project aimed at automating weed detection using machine learning techniques. The project leverages image recognition and computer vision to identify and classify weeds in real-time, potentially helping to reduce the manual effort required in agriculture and improve the efficiency of crop management.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weed Detection**: Utilizes a neural network model to segment and detect weeds from plant images.
- **High Accuracy**: The model is trained to achieve a high degree of accuracy in differentiating between crops and weeds.
- **Scalable and Flexible**: Can be adapted to different environments and scales, from small farms to larger agricultural operations.

## Installation

To set up the AI Weeder locally, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorwein/ai_weeder.git
cd ai_weeder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the main script to start the weed detection process:

```bash
python main.py --image_path [path_to_image]
```

Replace `[path_to_image]` with the actual path to the image you want to analyze.
