# AI Weeder üå±

AI Weeder is an open-source project aimed at automating weed detection using machine learning techniques. The project leverages image recognition and computer vision to identify and classify weeds in real-time, potentially helping to reduce the manual effort required in agriculture and improve the efficiency of crop management.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weed Detection**: Utilizes a neural network model to segment and detect weeds from plant images.
- **High Accuracy**: The model is trained to achieve a high degree of accuracy in differentiating between crops and weeds.
- **Scalable and Flexible**: Can be adapted to different environments and scales, from small farms to larger agricultural operations.

## Data

The data used in this project is available at the following link:

- [V2 Plant Seedlings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/v2-plant-seedlings-dataset)

This dataset includes images used for training and testing the weed detection model. Make sure to download the data and place it in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Installation

To set up the AI Weeder locally, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorwein/ai_weeder.git
cd ai_weeder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. **Download the Dataset**: Link above ‚òùÔ∏è

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**: Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the relevant Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

3. **Save the Model**: After training, make sure to save the trained model to `models/`

### Using the Trained Model

Once you have trained the model, you can use the API provided in the `ai_weeder_package/api/` directory to make predictions
